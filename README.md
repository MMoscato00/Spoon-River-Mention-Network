# Spoon-River-Mention-Network
This repository contains all datasets created for the character network analysis of the Spoon River Anthology, conducted as part of a Master’s thesis project in Digital and Public Humanities titled “Analyzing and Reassessing Texts through Character Interaction Networks: The Interpoetic Narrative of the Spoon River Anthology.”

The three datasets are as follows:
1. Sentiment Analysis Data: Data obtained from the sentiment analysis of poems that reference characters/poems from the anthology, inspired by residents of Lewistown.
2. Interaction Data: Data concerning mention interactions between characters/poems, represented as network edges with attributes including Source and Target Poem, Edition, whether the referenced poem is inspired by a Lewistown resident, Recorded Sentiment Value, and Type of Mention.
3. Poem Data: Data concerning poems in the form of network nodes, with the same attributes as above, plus an ID indicating the poem's position in the anthology's index.
